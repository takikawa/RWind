#| *** Workspace **** (aka desktops)

The children of the root window are the workspace's virtual roots (one per workspace).
The virtual root contains all the "top-level" windows of the clients.
To switch between workspaces, it suffices to unmap the current workspace and map the new one
(This is done by activate-workspace).

|#

#| 
- See sawfish/lisp/sawfish/wm/workspaces.jl
- evilwm, make-new-client
- Workspaces are organized into a list (no need for a vector since we don't expect more 
  than a dozen of them).
  The layout (grid, sphere, etc.) will be implemented on top of that.
- Convention: wk: workspace; wkn: workspace-number; w: window
